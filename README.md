# ZorahPractice
A feature-rich and slick practice plugin. This was built from the ground up by myself. I'm releasing this because it got leaked, so it's pointless to sell it.

**Requirements**
* Server must be running ZorahSpigot 1.7.10 (see lib folder)
* ProtocolLib 3.7.0

**Credits**
* Myself for building everything except the following:
* Para's Scoreboard API
* Bizarrealex's TabAPI (Kraken)
* filoghost's HiddenStringUtil
* aadnk's EntityHider
