# ZorahPractice
A feature-rich and slick practice plugin. This was built from the ground up by myself. I'm releasing this because it got leaked, so it's pointless to sell it.

**Requirements**
* Server must be running PotionSpigot (provided)
* ProtocolLib 3.7.0

**Building**
* Must be built with PotionSpigot & PotionSpigot API dependencies.

**Credits**
* Myself for building everything except the following:
* iHCF's Scoreboard API (which is shit)
* Bizarrealex's TabAPI (Kraken) (also shit)
* filoghost's HiddenStringUtil
* aadnk's EntityHider
